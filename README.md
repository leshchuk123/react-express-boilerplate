# react-express-boilerplate

Basic boilerplate project for **React** v18 frontend and **Express** server backend applications.

**Typescript**, **React Router** v6, **SASS**, **css-modules** configured for the frontend application.

Also `prettier`, `eslint` and `husky` added.

## Scripts

In root directory:
- `npm app-install` - installs both backend and frontend dependencies;
- `npm start` - starts both backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 3000) applications;

Similarly, `npm start` scripts can run applications in their own directories independently of each other.
